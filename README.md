# NTU_3DCV-2022_HW2
> This is a homework for 3D Computer Vision with Deep Learning Applications.

The goal is to solve 2 problems:
1. 2D-3D Matching
    > For each validation image, compute its camera pose with respect to world coordinate. Find the 2D-3D correspondence by descriptor matching, and solve the camera pose. Implement at least one kind of algorithm that solves a PnP problem. Briefly explain your implementation and write down the pseudo code in your report.

    result:\
    implement P3P+RANSAC

    > Q1-2:For each camera pose you calculated, compute the median pose error (translation, rotation) with respect to ground truth camera pose. Provide some discussion.

    result:
    |Table of error|||
    |--|--|--|
    ||rotation|translation|
    |P3P + ransac (icp)|0.02759|0.07028|
    |cv2.solvePnPRansac(Using P3P)|0.00628|0.00411|

    > Q1-3: For each camera pose you calculated, plot the trajectory and camera poses along with 3d point cloud model using Open3D. Explain how you draw and provide some discussion.

2. Augmented Reality
    > Q2-1: With camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, place a virtual cube in the the validation image sequences to create an Augmented reality video. Draw the virtual cube as a point set with different colors on its surface. Implement a simply but efficient painterâ€™s algorithm to determine the order of drawing.
